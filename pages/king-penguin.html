            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>King penguins are the second-largest penguin species, known for their sleek
                bodies, striking orange and yellow markings, and remarkable endurance in harsh subantarctic climates.
                Found on islands such as South Georgia, the Falklands, and Kerguelen, they thrive in cold waters rich in
                fish and squid. Unlike other penguins, king penguins have an extended breeding cycle, taking over a year
                to raise a single chick. Their ability to dive deep—often over 300 meters (1,000 feet)—and their highly
                social nature make them one of the most fascinating and resilient penguin species.</p>

            <h2>Brown Chicks</h2>
            <p>King penguin chicks are covered in thick, fluffy brown feathers, which make them look strikingly
                different from the sleek, black-and-white adults. This brown down helps keep them warm during the harsh
                subantarctic winters while they wait for their parents to return with food. Early explorers once
                mistakenly thought these chicks were a different species, calling them "woolly penguins" due to their
                unusual appearance. As they grow, they gradually shed their brown feathers and develop the smooth,
                waterproof plumage of an adult, a process that takes about a year.</p>

            <h2>King Penguin vs. Emperor Penguin</h2>
            <p>At first glance, these two species may seem quite similar, not to mention their names also are
                alike&mdash;both being named after rulers.
                However, while these two birds do have a lot in common, they also are very unique from each other. Below
                is a comparison of just a few of their differences.</p>

            <h3>King</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>second largest</strong> species of penguin, growing up to around 37 inches tall.</li>
                <li>Inhabit subantarctic islands, such as South Georgia and the Falklands, where temperatures are milder than in Antarctica.</li>
                <li>Have a longer breeding cycle than Emperor penguins, taking <strong>over a year</strong> to raise a single chick, meaning some breed twice in three years.</li>
                <li>King chicks look nothing like Emperor chicks. King chicks are extra fluffy and brown all over. See image comparison below.</li>
