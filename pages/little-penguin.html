                <p>Little penguins, also known as fairy penguins or blue penguins, are the smallest penguin species.
                    Found along the coastlines of Australia and New Zealand, they are easily recognized by their
                    distinctive blue feathers, which help them blend into the ocean. They are
                    excellent swimmers, using their flipper-like wings to propel themselves through the water in search
                    of small fish and squid. Little penguins are also highly social and often nest
                    in large colonies near sandy beaches and rocky shores.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Unlike larger penguins, Little penguins spend the day hunting at sea and return to their burrows
                        after sunset to avoid predators like seagulls and foxes.</li>
                    <li>These penguins dig burrows in sand or soil, but in some urban areas, they’ve been found nesting
                        under decks, sheds, and even inside people's gardens!</li>
                    <li>Despite their small size, Little penguins can swim at speeds of up to 3.7 mph (Emperor speed:
                        3.7-5.6 mph) and dive
                        over 65 feet (20 meters) deep while hunting for fish.</li>
                    <li>Little penguins are known to form monogamous pairs that stay together for the breeding season,
                        and generally pair up for life!</li>

                <h2>Environment</h2>
                <p>Little penguins thrive along the coastlines of southern Australia and New Zealand, often nesting on
                    rocky shores, sandy beaches, and small offshore islands. They are well adapted to both land and sea
                    environments, spending most of their lives at sea, where they dive to hunt for fish, squid, and
                    small marine creatures. On land, they nest in burrows, which they dig themselves or use existing
                    shelters, like spaces under rocks or human structures.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Their presence has a positive effect on the
                    environment, as their guano (droppings) fertilize the soil, enriching the coastal ecosystems where
                    they live. This helps support the growth of vegetation, which in turn provides shelter and food for
                    other wildlife. However, their habitats are also vulnerable to human activity, such as coastal
                    development and pollution, which can disrupt their nesting sites and food sources.

                <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-fish-fins"></i> Diet</h3>
                <p>Little penguins primarily feed on small fish, such as anchovies and sardines, as well as squid and
                    other marine invertebrates. They hunt by diving underwater and using their powerful flippers to
                    chase and catch their prey. Their diet can vary depending on the availability of food, with little
                    penguins often hunting in coastal waters and diving to depths of up to 65 feet. Little penguins
                    typically forage in small groups, which allows them to cooperate when hunting for food and improves
                    their efficiency in catching prey. Their feeding habits also prevent overpopulation of certain prey
                    species, ensuring a healthier and more diverse food web in their coastal environments.

            <section id="behavior-seasonal">
                <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-temperature-high"></i> Seasonal</h3>
                <p>Little penguins do not migrate but instead remain in their coastal habitats year-round, adjusting
                    their behaviors with the changing seasons. During the breeding season, which typically occurs in the
                    spring and summer months (from September to February), they are more active on land, forming nesting
                    pairs and raising chicks. In the cooler autumn and winter months, little penguins primarily stay at
                    sea for hunting, as food is abundant during these times. While they experience temperate climates,
                    with temperatures ranging from around 46°F to 61°F, they are well adapted to cold
                    water but are sensitive to extreme weather conditions and disturbances in their nesting
                    environments.

                <h3><i class="fa-solid fa-skull"></i> Threats</h3>
                <p>Little penguins face several threats that impact their populations and habitats. Predators, both
                    native and introduced, pose a significant risk, with animals like foxes, dogs, and seagulls often
                    preying on eggs, chicks, and adult penguins. Habitat destruction due to urban development and
                    coastal pollution also threatens their nesting areas, as human activities encroach on their natural
                    environment. Additionally, climate change has caused fluctuations in food availability, as warmer
                    waters affect the distribution of fish and squid, which are key components of their diet.
                    Overfishing and oil spills further reduce their food sources and increase the risk of contamination.
