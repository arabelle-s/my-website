                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Penguins are unique, flightless seabirds known for their adorable waddle, striking
                        black-and-white coloring, and incredible swimming abilities. Found primarily in the Southern
                        Hemisphere, these birds thrive in a range of environments, from the icy shores of Antarctica to
                        the warm beaches of South America, Africa, and even the Galápagos Islands. Their social nature,
                        fascinating behaviors, and remarkable adaptations make them one of
                        the most beloved and recognizable birds in the world.

                    <h3>Basic information</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>They live on coasts and feed exclusively on seafood.</li>
                        <li>They spend a large portion of their time (up to 75% of their lives!) in the water.</li>
                        <li>The largest groups of penguins live on Antarctic coasts.</li>
                        <li>Migration is common among penguins, although the process varies by species. Some travel
                            distances around 60 miles, while others make journies thousands of miles long!</li>

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>The black and white coloring featured by most species of penguins is a form of camouflage called
                    countershading. </li>
                <br>
                <li>Most birds have hollow bones to allow flight, but penguins have solid bones for swimming.</li>
                <br>
                <li>A group of penguins in the water is called a raft, But a group of penguins on land is called a
                    waddle!</li>
                <br>
                <li>The Emperor penguin holds the record for the deepest dive of any bird, reaching depths of over 1,800
                    feet, and often staying underwater for more than 20 minutes while hunting for fish.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Some species, like the Adélie and Gentoo penguins, present a special pebble to their mate as part of
                    their courtship ritual. If the other penguin accepts, they use it to build their nest together.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Since penguins often live in massive colonies with thousands of birds, they rely on unique vocal
                    calls to identify their mates and chicks rather than sight or smell.</li>
                <br>
                <li>After the female lays an egg, the male Emperor penguin balances it on his feet and covers it with a
                    warm flap of skin called a brood pouch, keeping it warm for about two months while fasting in the
                    freezing Antarctic winter.</li>
